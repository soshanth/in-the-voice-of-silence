## In the Voice of Silence

This isn’t a book with random thoughts. But a responsibility all by itself. 

Through my poems, I will take the responsibility of sprouting new, positive, rejuvenated thoughts in you. 

And, together with the funds we raise from this book, we shall renew the hopes of the eco-system in our lakes of Bengaluru. 

### Contributing to a cause

This book is dedicated to the maintenance of the lakes in Bengaluru. All the royalty (100%) that I earn from this book directly goes to the account of Anand Malligavad’s foundation.

The funds that we get from this book will be utilised in the maintenance of the lakes in Bengaluru.

**“Rejuvenation of lakes have renewed the hopes in the eco-system. Let us work towards nurturing the hopes”.**
