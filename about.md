## In the Voice of Silence

#### Silence isn’t empty, it is full of answers

This isn’t a book with random thoughts. But a responsibility all by itself. 

Through my poems, I would take the responsibility of sprouting new, positive, rejuvenated thoughts in you. 

And, together with the funds we raise from this book, we shall renew the hopes of the eco-system in our lakes of Bengaluru.
